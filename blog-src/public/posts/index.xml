      <description>First, What is Serverless? In the last blog post Kubernetes for Newbies, we went over how to get an application up and running on Kubernetes. Though Kubernetes is surely a hot topic in tech, the “serverless” space has become just as (if not even more) trendy. Why is serverless so popular in the dev community?
Turns out, serverless is a developer’s saving grace when it comes to managing servers. Instead of managing a bunch of servers, Serverless solutions allow developers to … well … not manage servers at all!</description>

      <description>Over the past 3 or so years, it seems the term “containerization” and the name “Kubernetes” have been amplified throughout the tech community non-stop. Even with that being so, as a developer, it can be easy to shy away from Kubernetes as its learning curve is notorious for being a steep one. But everyone’s gotta start somewhere, right? This tutorial will give you a basic overview of some of main features of Kubernetes, while walking you through the process of running a simple HelloWorld Golang application locally on your machine to running it on Kubernetes.</description>
